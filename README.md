Installation folders and instructions for Clingo and Clasp can be found on the Potassco github page, https://github.com/potassco. Navigate into one of the folders (12_bar, rhythm or simple) and run this command: clingo bass.lp > bass. This will produce a file called bass containing a stable model which can be parsed later. Next run this command: clingo guitar.lp > guitar. This will produce a file called guitar which can be parsed later. 

The parseSet file in the repository is currently a jupyter notebook file (.ipynb file). Therefore, the file needs to be open with a jupyter notebook. Once opened in jupyter, run the notebook. A sound bar containing the audio of the composition and stave of the composition in musical notation will show. Furthermore, the notebook will produce a MIDI file. 

Musescore can be downloaded from this site: https://musescore.org/en/download. After downloading musescore, navigate to the folder where the composition.mid file is located and open with musecore. Musescore will assign piano as the instrument to the composition. Therefore, locate edit in the toolbar and choose instruments. Add an electric and bass guitar to the composition. Copy the notes from the piano stave to the electric and bass guitar staves. Hide or remove the piano stave. The composition can now be played with the appropriate instruments.
